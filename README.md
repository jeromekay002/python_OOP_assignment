Description
## Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️
1. Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
2. Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
3. Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭

Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" 🚗, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ✈️).

## Submission:
